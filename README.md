# expense-tracker
In this project, i have built an simple expense tracker which uses HTML,CSS and vanilla JS.
this project was heavily inspired by brad teraversy's version.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFDcZABiDQ&t=11s

This web project functions on basic mathamatical operators(addition and subtraction)
